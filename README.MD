A short Project to comply with an Interview for Uken Games.
The main purpose of the project is to find the least frequent number in a given dataset of n terms from a formatted text file. If there is a collision, the lowest number sharing the same frequency is reported instead. 
Please note: I haven't deleted the garbage files from the project yet, so there's a fair bit of bloat here.
There is a shortcut to the main executable file located in the root repository file (Uken_Games_Interview) named "Interview Q1 - Text_file_reader - Shortcut" forgive me for the terrible naming convention I simply haven't bothered to change it as of yet.

There are 5 sample files included, found within:
Uken_Games_Interview\Interview Q1 - Text_File_reader\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1
if you would like to try your own custom files, you may place them in there, alternatively, if you'd like to search from another directory, simply specify the directory you'd wish to use like so: 
@"C:\\Your_Target_Folder" within the source code's .sln file where the function call for ReadFile and CalculateFrequency are located.
